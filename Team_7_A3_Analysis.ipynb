These are five broad dimensions of personality that may help to anticipate and understand human behavior. The five different traits are as follows:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " \n",
    "* <strong>Extroversion (E):</strong> characterized by excitability, socialiability, talkativeness, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. <strong>High</strong> scorers tend to be very outgoing and gain energy in social settings, while <strong>low</strong> scorers tend to be more reserved, and may find social events draining. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <strong>Agreeableness (A):</strong> reflects much individuals adjust their behavior to suit others. <strong>High</strong> scorers are typically cooperative and polite; <strong>low</strong> scorers tend to be more competitive and blunt. <br>\n",

    "<br>The Hult DNA skills appear to have no significant difference in respondents’ behaviors. This may be attributed to the fact that a growth mindset, the ultimate success measure of the Hult DNA skills, takes time to develop and builds up long-term. It takes an average of 66 days to develop a new habit, which can “vary widely depending on the behavior, the person, and the circumstances”, and requires constant repetition of that behavior <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674\">(Lally, 2010).</a>\n",
    " \n",
    "This is to say that the growth mindset must be practiced rather than just preached, and there is no guarantee that students have inherently adopted this mindset nor that they want to personally put in the effort to do so. \n",
    "Therefore, it may not be a good measure to get insight into consumer buying behaviors and decision-making processes.</br>\n",
    "<br>Further, the same survey could be administered to Hult alumni whom have had a longer time to imbibe the growth mindset skills. This will help us understand whether the differences in clusters are significant and if positive, we can do a separate analysis to get further insights.</br>"
